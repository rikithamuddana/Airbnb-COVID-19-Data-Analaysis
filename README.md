## Introduction
For this project, we are looking into the Covid-19 impact on the San Francisco Air BnB market. San Francisco was one of the first cities in the US deeply affected by Covid-19, with its first case on February 3 and an official lockdown order going into place on March 16. The lockdown remained in effect until June 1. This caused many small businesses, particularly in the travel and tourism industry, to have to shut down for extended periods of time. Because of this, we wanted to analyze how the pandemic affected the Air BnB market along with the projections for the future and which types of listings are most likely to survive through the pandemic without closing their doors.
Through this, we are looking to answer the following questions:

●	How does the COVID 19 pandemic affect the selected city’s Airbnb market?

●	What factors have affected Airbnb hosts’ market exit decisions?

●	What types of properties have been affected the most?

As a note, because of the amount of code generated along with the current length of the report, exact codes for replication are included within the associated code files folder. All files are named respective to the section they cover in the report.
